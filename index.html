# GOAL: Streams are the most excellent data type

---

# Agenda

* Step 1: Streams?
* Step 2: Streams in JS
* Step 3: PRACTICAL streams in JS

---

# Step 1: Streams? Streams!

---

# Unix!

---

# Defining a stream

---

# Streams are an abstract data structure

---

# REAL WORLD DEMO

---

# SICP says "Streams are delayed lists"

---

# Why?

* Can't hold everything in memory
* Bandwidth is expensive

---

# STREAMS!!!

---

# Represent possibly INFINITE DATA

---

# INFINITE

---

# DATA

---

# = WIZARDS

---

# What are some things that don't have an end?

---

* Natural numbers
* Natural phenomena
* User input
* Large data sets*
* Your heartbeat*

---

SICP: “Stream processing lets us model systems that have state without ever using assignment or mutable data.”

---

# AWESOME

---

# Step 2: Streams in Practice

---

# Ex: Proxy Server

---

# Push &amp; Pull Modes

---

# Push: Firehose
* Callbacks
* Non-blocking
* Downside is possible overload

---

# Pull: Gimme gimme
* Iterators
* Blocking
* Timeout (never ever block forever)

---

# When to use push or pull?

---

# Step 3: Streams in JavaScript

---
# Node streams

---

# Stream

---

# Generators!

---

# Code slides
