# OMG STREAMS
### with Pam Selle, @pamasaur thewebivore.com

class: center, middle

# Thesis:
Streams are the most &#x1F31F;awesome&#x1F31F; data structure you didn't know enough about

---

# Agenda

* Step 1: Streams? STREAMS!!!
* Step 2: Streams in practice
* Step 3: Streams in JavaScript

---

# Step 1: Streams? STREAMS!!!

---

# Streams?

---

# Unix!

---

# Streams are an abstract data structure

---

# REAL WORLD DEMO

---

# SICP says "Streams are delayed lists"

---

# Why streams?

* Can't hold everything in memory
* Bandwidth is expensive

---

# STREAMS!!!

---

# Represent possibly INFINITE DATA

---

# INFINITE

---

# DATA

---

# = WIZARDS

---

# What are some things that don't have an end?

---

* Natural numbers
* Natural phenomena
* User input
* Large data sets*
* Your heartbeat*

---

# “Stream processing lets us model systems that have state without ever using assignment or mutable data.” - SICP

---

# AWESOME

---

# AGAIN! AGAIN!

---

# “Stream processing lets us model systems that have state without ever using assignment or mutable data.” - SICP

---

# Step 2: Streams in Practice

---

# Ex: Proxy Server

---

# Push &amp; Pull Modes

---

# Push: Firehose
* Callbacks
* Non-blocking
* Downside is possible overload

---

# Pull: Gimme gimme
* Iterators
* Blocking
* Timeout (never ever block forever)

---

# When to use push or pull?

---

# Step 3: Streams in JavaScript

---

# Node streams

---

# Classic Example (from substack):

---

``` js
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    fs.readFile(__dirname + '/data.txt', function (err, data) {
        res.end(data);
    });
});
server.listen(8000);
```
---

``` js
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    var stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/data.txt');
    stream.pipe(res);
});
server.listen(8000);
```

---

# Generators!

---

# Generators
* function*
* yield

---

``` js
function* something() {
  yield 2;
}
```

---

``` js
var s = something()
s.next()
```

---

# Larger generators sample

---

# Generators as iterators

---

# caniuse?

Ish. You probably want BabelJS.

---

# Libraries for Working with Streams

---

# BaconJS || HighlandJS || RxJS

---

![bacon](images/friendly-baconjs.png)

---

# HighlandJS

"The Stream constructor, accepts an array of values or a generator function as an optional argument."

Possible sources: Arrays, Generators, Node readable streams, EventEmitter/jQuery Elements, Promises

---

# RxJS

Reactive things. Stream-friendly.

# Translation

No one can really explain what FRP is, but this video can help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agu6jipKfYw

---

# Emerging standards!

---

# Browser streams standard

https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/

---

# Fetch API

https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/

``` js
  fetch(SOME_DATA).then(function(response) {
    return response.json() // Eventually, STREAMS!!
  }).then(function (data) {
    ...
  }).catch(function(error) {
    ...
  })
```

(not in JavaScript &hellip; yet)

# A couple projects with streams!
