# OMG STREAMS
### with Pam Selle, @pamasaur thewebivore.com

class: center, middle

# Thesis:
Streams are the most &#x1F31F;awesome&#x1F31F; data structure you didn't know enough about

---

# Agenda

* Step 1: Streams? STREAMS!!!
* Step 2: Streams in JavaScript
* Step 3: Libraries &amp; Emerging Standards

---

# Step 1: Streams? STREAMS!!!

---

# Streams?

---

# History

---

# Unix!

---

# All glory to "pipe"

---

> cat bestanimals.txt | grep -i cats

---

> cat bestanimals.txt .red[|] grep -i cats

---

# But what ARE streams?

---

# Streams are an abstract data structure

---

# REAL WORLD DEMO

---

# SICP says "Streams are delayed lists"

---

# Why streams?

* Can't/don't want to hold everything in memory
* Bandwidth is expensive

---

# STREAMS!!!

---

# Represent possibly INFINITE DATA

---

# INFINITE

---

# DATA

---

# = WIZARDS

---

# What are some things that don't have an end?

---

* Natural numbers
* Weather
* User input (ex. keystrokes)
* Large data sets*
* Your heartbeat*

---

# “Stream processing lets us model systems that have state without ever using assignment or mutable data.” - SICP

---

# AWESOME

---

# AGAIN! AGAIN!

---

# “Stream processing lets us model systems that have state without ever using assignment or mutable data.” - SICP

---

# Push &amp; Pull Modes

---

# Push: Firehose
![Firehydrant](images/firehydrant.gif)

---

# Push: Firehose
* Callbacks
* Non-blocking
* Downside is possible overload

---

# Pull: More please
![horse pulling people](http://media.riemurasia.net/albumit/mmedia/7/a1v/6x3g/386766/1340592239.gif)

---

# Pull: More please
* Iterators
* Blocking
* Timeout (never ever block forever)

---

# Step 2: Streams in JavaScript

---

# Node streams

---

# Node streams are push streams

---

# Classic Example (from substack):

---

``` js
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    fs.readFile(__dirname + '/data.txt', function (err, data) {
        res.end(data);
    });
});
server.listen(8000);
```
---

## The important bit
``` js
fs.readFile(__dirname + '/data.txt', function (err, data) {
  res.end(data);
});
```
---

``` js
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    var stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/data.txt');
    stream.pipe(res);
});
server.listen(8000);
```

---

## The important bit
``` js
  var stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/data.txt');
  stream.pipe(res);
```
---

# Piping rather than using memory!

---

# Verdict
## Node streams are awesome, non-blocking push data sources

---

# Generators!

---

# Generators are _pausable_ functions

---

# &hellip; or &hellip;

---

# PULL STREAMS?
![dramatic cat](images/dramatic-cat.gif)

---

# Ask for more when you want more
(aka: pull streams!)

---
# You know it's a generator when &hellip;
* function*
* yield

---

``` js
function* something() {
  yield 2;
}
```

---

``` js
function* something() {
  yield 2;
}

var s = something()
s.next()
```

---

# Generators demos!

---

# caniuse?

Ish. You probably want BabelJS.

---

# Step 3: Libraries &amp; Emerging Standards

---

# Libraries for working with streams

---

# BaconJS || HighlandJS || RxJS

---

![bacon](images/friendly-baconjs.png)

---

# HighlandJS

"The Stream constructor, accepts an array of values or a generator function as an optional argument."

---

# Highland: Single interface for many data types

Possible sources: Arrays, Generators, Node readable streams, EventEmitter/jQuery Elements, Promises

---

# RxJS

Reactive tools. Stream-friendly. Batteries included.

---

# Hold on &hellip; reactive programming?

---

# Emerging standards!

---

# Browser streams standard

https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/

---

# Fetch API

https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/

``` js
  fetch(SOME_DATA).then(function(response) {
    return response.json() // Eventually, STREAMS!!
  }).then(function (data) {
    ...
  }).catch(function(error) {
    ...
  })
```

---

# Async Generators
[An upcoming proposal for ES7](https://github.com/jhusain/asyncgenerator)

``` js
// data producer
async function* nums() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

// data consumer
async function printData() {
  for(var x on nums()) {
    console.log(x);
  }
}
```

# Small projects using some of these tools:

# Last Week Blog
Tell me what's new from the last week on my blogs!

---

# SpaceTime App
Uses the Fetch API. No streams yet :(
